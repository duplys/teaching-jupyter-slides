# Introduction
The material in this repository shows how to create slides using Jupyter.


# Running Jupyter
If you are at least somewhat familiar with Docker, the easiest way to run Jupyter is by using the [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a set of Docker images containing Jupyter applications and interactive computing tools and maintained by the Jupyter team.

As an example, to run a `scipy-notebook`, a Jupyter Docker Stacks image that includes numerous packages from the Python's scientific ecosystem, you can simply issue:

```shell
$ docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook
```
